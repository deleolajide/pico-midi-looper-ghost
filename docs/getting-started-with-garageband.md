When you hear the click sound, you're ready to go. Press the button on your Pico and let your rhythm come to life!

> ⚠️ Note: Wireless earphones introduce noticeable latency, which makes them unsuitable for live rhythm performance. For the best experience, use the device’s built-in speaker or wired headphones.
